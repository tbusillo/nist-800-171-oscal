# Unofficial OSCAL Formatted Version of NIST SP 800-171 Rev.2 

The [Open Security Controls Assessment Language](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) (OSCAL) is a NIST/US Government effort to create, "machine-readable representations of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, and assessment plans and results". NIST has done some incredible work thus far, but their efforts have understandably been concentrated on baselines/catalogs for safeguarding Federal information systems (e.g., NIST 800-53 rev4/5).
